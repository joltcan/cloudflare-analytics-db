# [Python](https://python.org) script to grab [Cloudflare](https://api.cloudflare.com/#zone-analytics-dashboard) analytics to your own [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) database. 

I use this to populate my [Grafana](https://grafana.org) dashboard with Cloudflare analytics.

# TL;DR
* Install [psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/): ```sudo pip install psycopg2-binary```
* ```cp .env-sample .env``` or set those as environment variables in your shell before running
* Fill in the secrets (or set those as environment variables in your shell before running)
* put it in your crontab: ```@hourly cd $HOME/src/cloudflare-analytics-db/ ; . ./.env ; sleep $((RANDOM \% 10 * 60)) ; python ./cloudflare-analytics-db.py```. This will sleep for some random minutes before running (\% is escaped due to how cron handle variables).

# Installation
* Install PostgreSQL ```sudo apt install postres``` or run it with [docker].(https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/)
  * Create the user ```sudo -u postgres createuser -E -P cf_api```
  * Create the database ```sudo -u postgres createdb -O cf_api cf_api```
* Follow the TL;DR above to add it to your crontab. An alternative is to set the ENVIRONMENT directly instead of using the .env file, but I use [autoenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv), so it's very convenient for me.

# Why?
* I love Cloudflare and Grafana and wanted to integrate their data in my dashboard, but I needed it to be stored somewhere first :/
* Postgres? I like it, and also, it handles JSON splendidly!

# Todo
- [ ] Add the Grafana dashboard code here as example.
- [X] Add Grafana postgresql code.
- [X] Screenshots, because why not!

# Grafana
## Postgres read permission for Grafana user
```sudo -u postgres psql postgres```
```
CREATE USER grafanaread WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '<grafana read-only pw>';
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public to grafanaread;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO grafanareader;
GRANT SELECT ON cf_api TO grafanareader;
```

## Grafana dashboard panel
The query used for a panel needs to use the PostgreSQL database, so set that up as a source first.
After that, you can c'n'p the following into a table or graph, and hopefully you should get something useful back!

### Tables
```sql
SELECT 
  data->>'until' as time,
  cast(data->'bandwidth'->>'all' as integer) as "Total",
  cast(data->'bandwidth'->>'cached' as integer) as "Cached"
FROM 
  cf_api 
WHERE
  to_timestamp(data->>'until', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') between ($__timeFrom() at time zone 'UTC') AND ($__timeTo() at time zone 'UTC')
```

The reason it looks over-complicated is that the Cloudflare data is in UTC (a.k.a. Zulu) timezone, but you are most likely not, and I didn't find an override in the Grafana postgres templates. It works great as above in tables, but for graphs, then you need to convert it from UTC to local, and this is why I made this ugly beast below:

### Graphs
```sql
SELECT 
  (to_timestamp(data->>'until', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS')::timestamptz::timestamp) as time,
  cast(data->'bandwidth'->>'all' as integer) as "Total",
  cast(data->'bandwidth'->>'cached' as integer) as "Cached"
FROM 
  cf_api 
WHERE
  to_timestamp(data->>'until', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') between ($__timeFrom() at time zone 'UTC') AND ($__timeTo() at time zone 'UTC')
```

Anyway. It works!
